### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me a lot for the CSS properties. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.getbootstrap.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand boostrap and helped a lot in making the page responsive. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
